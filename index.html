          find simplicity in the life you already living. </p>

          <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
          <p>Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with others and
            it
            leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out. </p>

          <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
          <p>A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go overboard and
            it
            doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want it to and
            make things pop like never before. </p>
